// In pure ESM web bundles, you must call init() and wait for the promised result before you can
// call any module methods. To make that as easy as possible, this module directly exposes the
// init() promise result, and returns the methods at the end of the promise.

// For usage with an importmap, it's convenient to add the ".js" extension here, because browsers
// don't try to guess the file extension.
